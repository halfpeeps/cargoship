												Important Info
-Please comment your code so others can understand it
-Use the correct suffexes (seen above)
-Try and keep the files tidy
-If you are going to rewrite a large portion of someone elses code, copy it into \notes\legacy_code\
-subsystems are imported from other libs.  Don't touch them (we have no idea what magic makes them work)
-If you are importing a font, make sure we are licensed to use it
-Copy fonts to project if importing
-When making new rooms, duplicate rm_template (creating a new room from scratch will break a lot of code)
